        <h2 class="subsection header">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="subsection unordered list">
            <li>9 ounces bittersweet chocolate, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon dark rum (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2 class="subsection header">Steps</h2>
        <ol class="subsection ordered list">
            <li>Place chocolate in a medium mixing bowl.</li>
            <li>Heat cream in a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring just to a boil, watching very carefully because if it boils for even a few seconds, it will boil out of the pot.</li>
            <li>As soon as the cream comes to a boil, pour it over the chocolate in the mixing bowl. Whisk until chocolate has melted and mixture is smooth, then stir in rum.</li>
            <li>To use ganache as a cake glaze, cool slightly, 5 to 10 minutes. Start pouring glaze at the center of the cake and work outward.</li>
            <li>For a fluffy frosting or chocolate filling, allow it to cool until thick (up to 1 hour in the refrigerator), and then whip until light and fluffy. Apply it with a spatula like a conventional frosting.</li>
        </ol>
